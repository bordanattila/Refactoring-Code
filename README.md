# Refactoring Existing Code

## Description

The web is for everyone and it should be accessible for everyone including those whoes abilites are limited. 
Applying semantic HTML elements elements help students to build better habits and learn best prctices in terms of accessibility.
Implementing semantic HTML elements gives people with disabilities access to the information coveyed through the website.
Througout this project I learned a lot about the keeping accessibiltiy in mind when building website and the differenec between displaying image in HTML or in CSS.
